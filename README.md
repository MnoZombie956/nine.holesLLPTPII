First Qt application in the laboratory of Programming Languages course, the goal was to create a graphical user interface. To spice things up, in order to make use of
what the Qt toolkit had offer, we implemented a simple game for the user to interact with and added some textures(just images) for board a pieces.

How to Play ?
There are two phases, the first: each player places thier pieces on the board (alternatingly fashion), 
then we move on to the second phase: each player on their turn, move its pieces (horizontally or vertically, as indicated when you click your piece)
in order to complete a full line(three same pieces),
be it either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal one.
